# CRC Error Detection Program

This is a program that implements error detection using the CRC(Cyclic Redundancy Check) algorithm. 

The program generates a message(in the form of a string of k bits) and with the generator polynomial (also in the form of a string of bits), that the user gives, calculates the CRC. Then the message and CRC are transmitted over a wireless channel  with BER(Bit Error Rate) and the recepient receives the corrupted message.
